# Pokemon IRONÃ©MON Red Kaizo Edition

This is a Rom hack of the IronÃ©mon challenge created by [Iateyourpie](https://www.twitch.tv/iateyourpie). An IronÃ©mon is a set of self-imposed rules designed the make the pokemon games more challenging. This ROM hack enforces those rules into the game itself. The ROM hack takes a few liberties, for the original ruleset see [Original Ironmon rules](https://gist.github.com/valiant-code/adb18d248fa0fae7da6b639e2ee8f9c1)

[Custom Tracker for this patch is here](https://github.com/U-K-L/Ironmon-Tracker)
